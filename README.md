## Math Adventures with Python Exercies

***Math Adventures with Python*** is a book that shows how to harness the power of programming to keep math relevant and fun. Here the exercises cover how to visualize solutions to a range of math problems such as algebra, trigonometry, matrices, and cellular automata.

This also covers:
* Drawing and transforming 2D and 3D graphics with matrices.
* Make colorful designs like the Madelbrot and Julia sets with complex numbers.
* Use recursion to create fractals like the Koch snowflake and the Sierpinski triangle.
* Generate virtual sheep that graze on grass and multiply autonomously.
* Crack secret codes with genetic algorithms.
